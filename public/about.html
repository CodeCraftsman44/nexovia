					The Communio website is a project by students Janik Hamburger and Matvei Pikarevskis, developed as part of the Web Programming course <br/>
					in the Business Informatics â€“ Application Management program. It was entirely created using modern web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.<br/>
					The design of the website is inspired by a harmonious green matcha color theme, combining aesthetic appeal with originality. <br/>
					The goal was to create a user-friendly and elegant platform.<br/>
					A particularly noteworthy feature is the integration of login and sign-up functions, which enable secure and privacy-compliant use of the platform. <br/>
					The implementation of session management ensures that only authenticated users can access personal areas, such as private chats. <br/>
					This not only safeguards user privacy but also enhances the overall user experience. The chat functionality is characterized by a clear and intuitive layout, <br/>
					with sent messages aligned to the right and received messages to the left, significantly improving clarity and ease of use. <br/>
					Furthermore, session management allows for a personalized user journey, enabling targeted and efficient access to relevant content.<br/>
					The website combines modern design with well-thought-out functionality, showcasing the developers' expertise in web programming.<br/>
